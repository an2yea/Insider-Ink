# Insider-Ink

A Web3-powered platform for anonymous, verified employee feedback and transparent organizational reputation scoring.  

## How It Works  

### 1. **ZK Email Verification**  
- Users verify their email via **Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs**, confirming their affiliation with an organization (need to have an organisation domain email to signup)
- This process ensures:  
  - **Authenticity**: Users can only post about organizations they are a part of.  
  - **Anonymity**: Personal details remain undisclosed.  

### 2. **AI-Powered Content Analysis and Reputation Calculation**  
- **AI Algorithms**:  
  - Analyze posts to identify recurring themes and sentiment.  
  - Highlight key workplace issues and trends.  
- **True Network Reputation Algorithm**:  
  - Calculates organization reputation scores based on employee feedback.  
  - Provides an easily accessible metric for potential employees and others to evaluate an organization.  

### 3. **User Attestation Without Personal Disclosure**  
- Posts are securely attested on the blockchain.  
- Users maintain anonymity while validating the authenticity of their feedback.  

### 4. **Public Transparency**  
- Reputation scores and feedback are publicly accessible.  
- Job seekers and others can evaluate an organizationâ€™s internal culture and feedback to make informed decisions.  

## Key Features  
- **Anonymous, Verified Feedback**: Protects whistleblowers while ensuring content authenticity.  
- **Transparent Reputation Scores**: Fosters trust and informed decision-making for potential employees.  

## Technologies Used  
- **ZKEmail**: For email verification and login via Zero-Knowledge proofs.  
- **True Network**: For secure, blockchain-based attestations.  
- **MetaMask Login**: Email signups through org email through ZK; subsequent log ins exclusively through MetaMask.  

## Summary  
This platform empowers employees to share anonymous, verified feedback while providing transparency for organizations. It aims to:  
- Protect whistleblowers.  
- Foster accountability.  
- Help potential employees evaluate organizations effectively.
